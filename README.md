## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for running the full stack locally)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the example environment file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Useful Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server with automatic reloads via `tsx watch`. |
| `npm run opensearch:bootstrap` | Apply OpenSearch templates and ensure indices without starting the server. |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (`dist/`). |
| `npm start` | Run the compiled application. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Perform a type check without emitting files. |
| `npm test` | Execute the Jest test suite. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across `src/` and `tests/`. |
| `npm run format` | Verify Prettier formatting. |
| `npm run ci` | Run linting, type checks, and tests (useful for CI pipelines). |

## Running Locally

### Development Server Only

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Visit `http://localhost:3000/health` to inspect the aggregated health payload.

### Full Stack with Docker Compose

Spin up the API together with OpenSearch and PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command provisions:

- **api** ‚Äì Fastify service built from this repository (port `3000`).
- **postgres** ‚Äì PostgreSQL 16 database with seeded credentials (port `5432`).
- **opensearch** ‚Äì OpenSearch 2.x single-node cluster with security disabled for local development (ports `9200` and `9600`).

Health checks ensure dependent services are available before the API starts. Update the `.env` file if you need to change credentials or network bindings.

To tear everything down:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

## OpenSearch Integration

### Client configuration

- Credentials can be supplied directly via `OPENSEARCH_USERNAME`/`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` or mounted securely with the corresponding `*_FILE` environment variables that read from Docker secrets.
- Managed clusters that require TLS can provide a certificate authority with `OPENSEARCH_CA_CERT_PATH` and toggle strict verification with `OPENSEARCH_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`.
- The same client powers runtime health checks, so any connectivity or credential issues surface through the `/health` endpoint.

### Index templates & analyzers

The service manages two index templates and matching aliases on startup:

- **Reviews** (`reviews-template-v1`, alias `reviews`, pattern `reviews-*`)
  - `title` and `content` leverage a folded analyzer for case-insensitive matching, with keyword and autocomplete multi-fields for exact matches and prefix search.
  - `rating`, `helpfulVoteCount`, `viewCount`, and `averageSentiment` are numeric fields optimized for aggregations and scoring.
  - `status`, `userId`, `categoryTierId`, `keywords`, and `lastActivityAt` provide keyword/date fields for filtering and faceting.
- **Review activities** (`review-activities-template-v1`, alias `review-activities`, pattern `review-activities-*`)
  - Captures `quantity` as an integer alongside rolling aggregation buckets (`aggregation.rolling7d`, `aggregation.rolling30d`, `aggregation.total`).
  - Stores `type`, `userId`, and `reviewId` as normalized keywords for breakdowns and unique counts.
  - Indexes `notes` with both full-text search and keyword facets, while preserving `recordedAt`/`createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps for time-series queries.

Both templates share folded and autocomplete analyzers to enable intuitive relevance and type-ahead behaviour.

### Bootstrap workflow

- On service startup the API calls `bootstrapOpenSearchInfrastructure` to apply templates and create initial backing indices (`reviews-v1`, `review-activities-v1`) with write aliases when needed.
- Bootstrapping is skipped automatically during tests and can be disabled by setting `OPENSEARCH_BOOTSTRAP_ENABLED=false` for environments where infrastructure is managed externally.
- You can run the process manually without starting the server via `npm run opensearch:bootstrap`, which performs the same checks and exits once the cluster is prepared.

### Cloud vs. self-hosted clusters

Local development (Docker Compose) runs OpenSearch without security, so the defaults in `.env.example` work out of the box. For cloud-managed clusters:

1. Point `OPENSEARCH_NODE` at the managed HTTPS endpoint.
2. Provide credentials either inline (`OPENSEARCH_USERNAME`/`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD`) or through mounted secret files (`OPENSEARCH_USERNAME_FILE`/`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD_FILE`).
3. Supply the provider CA certificate with `OPENSEARCH_CA_CERT_PATH` and set `OPENSEARCH_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true` to enforce validation.
4. Optionally disable automatic bootstrapping if index lifecycle is controlled by infrastructure tooling.

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are validated on startup. Refer to [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for available settings and defaults. Detailed production configuration guidance (including observability flags) is available in [`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](./docs/OPERATIONS.md).

## Observability & Telemetry

The API ships with cross-cutting instrumentation enabled by default for development (and opt-in for production through `OTEL_ENABLED`).

### Structured logging

- Fastify's Pino logger captures JSON logs with request/response metadata and correlation IDs (`request.id`).
- Logs are safe for ingestion into ELK, Loki, or any structured logging backend.

### Centralized error handling

- A global error handler normalizes responses into a predictable shape (`statusCode`, `error`, `message`, `requestId`).
- Validation errors (powered by `zod`) automatically return a `400 ValidationError` with field-level details.
- Unhandled exceptions are logged and return a sanitized `500 Internal server error` payload in production.

### Metrics

- When `OTEL_ENABLED=true`, Prometheus metrics are exposed at `http://<host>:${OTEL_METRICS_PORT}${OTEL_METRICS_ENDPOINT}` (defaults to `http://localhost:9464/metrics`).
- Key metrics include `http.server.requests` (request counter) and `http.server.request.duration` (histogram with `ms` unit).
- Metrics are compatible with Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes `ServiceMonitor` resources.

### Tracing

- Distributed tracing is provided via OpenTelemetry; set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (and optional `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`) to forward spans to collectors such as Jaeger or Tempo.
- Spans cover HTTP requests, database operations (via Prisma), OpenSearch calls, and background indexing pipeline work.

### Graceful shutdown

- `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals trigger an orderly shutdown: draining HTTP requests, stopping the indexing pipeline, closing datastore clients, and flushing telemetry exporters.
- Shutdown progress is logged so platform teams can monitor rollout safety.

## Health Endpoint

`GET /health`

Returns an overview of the service status and underlying dependencies. In non-test environments, connection checks attempt to query PostgreSQL and OpenSearch. During automated tests, the checks are intentionally skipped to keep the suite deterministic.

## Domain Endpoints

All domain endpoints perform input validation via a global `zod`-powered middleware and persist data through Prisma. Centralized error handling ensures consistent responses for invalid input, missing resources, or business rule violations.

## Search API

`POST /search/reviews` blends full-text review search with composite boosting. The route issues a
multi-match query across review titles and content, then applies function-score boosts for active ad
campaigns and engagement totals. Results are enriched with aggregation buckets for analytics.

### Request body

```json
{
  "query": "wireless headphones",
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "sort": "relevance",
  "filters": {
    "categoryTierLevels": ["higher", "medium"],
    "adBoostStatuses": ["boosted"]
  }
}
```

* `query` *(optional)* ‚Äì free-text search terms matched against review titles and content.
* `page`/`pageSize` ‚Äì 1-indexed pagination with `pageSize` capped at 100.
* `sort` *(optional)* ‚Äì `relevance` (default) uses OpenSearch scoring; `newest` sorts by creation
  date.
* `filters.categoryTierLevels` *(optional)* ‚Äì restrict results to `lower` (priority ‚â§ 33),
  `medium` (34‚Äì66), or `higher` (‚â• 67) category tiers derived from stored priorities.
* `filters.adBoostStatuses` *(optional)* ‚Äì limit to `boosted` (remaining ad credits) or `organic`
  reviews.

## Deployment & Operations

For production deployments, consult the following guides:

- **[Operations Guide](./docs/OPERATIONS.md)** - Deployment strategies (Docker, Kubernetes), configuration best practices, monitoring setup, security considerations, and maintenance procedures.
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Quick reference for diagnosing and resolving common issues related to startup, runtime errors, performance, and external service connectivity.

Key production features:

- **Graceful shutdown**: Handles `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` signals to drain requests, close connections, and flush telemetry before exit.
- **Health checks**: `GET /health` endpoint provides detailed status for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes and load balancer health checks.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration for metrics (Prometheus) and distributed tracing (Jaeger/Tempo).
- **Secrets management**: Supports Docker secrets via `*_FILE` environment variables for sensitive credentials.
- **Cluster-ready**: Stateless design enables horizontal scaling and rolling deployments without downtime.
